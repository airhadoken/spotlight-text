This is spotlight-text, an HTML5 canvas experiment.

To play with this experiment, type any text into the text box and it 
will first display with a left-to-right swipe (as in a 
sweeping spotlight), then disappear with the same transition.

Particle effects happen around the spotlight arc where the text is 
sweeping in and out.
